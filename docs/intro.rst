Introduction
============
**Entropic Trajectories** is a framework for solving many-body physical systems
using various techniques such as *smooth particle hydrodynamics* in the context
of entropic inference.  It is closely related to the techniques developed from
the context of Bohmian mechanics which are typically called *Quantum trajectory
methods*.

The ET framework is written in C++ and wrapped in python using pybind11.
